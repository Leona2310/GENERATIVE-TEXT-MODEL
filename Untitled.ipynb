      "Artificial intelligence  is currently a major focus of research at the University of Michigan, and has been shown to help us understand our own emotions. The main challenge for AI researchers is to create systems that can recognize our emotions, and this means understanding how to use their emotions to interact with humans. In this paper I will describe a new approach to understanding emotional expression, using a technique known as Bayesian inference. This is an approach that uses a mixture of Bayesian inference and Bayesian prediction to help us understand the emotion state of a system. I will explain how Bayesian inference works, and how it works in more detail.\n",
      "As we know, human emotions are strongly connected to each other. In fact, humans are the most likely to have emotional responses to a particular emotion. But this connection is also an important aspect of human emotion development. When we are emotionally emotional, we have very little control over our emotions, and this leads to a lot of conflict. As we develop our emotions, we can use this conflict to build new systems. In this paper I will show how a simple Bayesian inference approach will help us develop a Bayesian inference system. This approach also makes it possible to use a simple Bayesian prediction system to predict human emotion.\n",
